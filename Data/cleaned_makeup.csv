milani,Milani Color Statement Lipliner,"Inspired by the Milan Runway, two new shades to line and fill-in lips. Features:True instant colour in one stroke applicationLong wearing, easy-glide formulaNo dragSharpens with Milani’s Duo SharpenerNon-feathering formulaApplication: To outline your lips, make an X on the center of your upper lip (lip cleavage). Following the contour of your mouth, start from the outer edges of your lips and work your way towards center of your upper lip (where the x is marked). This will prevent from making one arch higher, pointier or rounder than the other.  Tip: Lipliner helps extend the wear & keeps your lipstick from feathering.   When choosing a lipliner shade, match the lipliner to your lipstick shade or match your lipliner to the shade of your lips which will work with all your lipstick shades.   Create a custom lipcolor by using a contrasting lipliner and lipstick shade.   Before applying your lipliner, pat your lips lightly with your foundation or pressed powder puff, which also helps keep you lipstick from feathering.
